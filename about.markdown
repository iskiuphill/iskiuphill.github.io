We're a group of uphill skiers that are finding it difficult to find uphill policy information for their local mountains and this definitely means others are having a difficult time. Through book marking the pages for each resort and having those pages become 404 pages has become frustrating. So, we decided to build a much easier site that will aggregate these and update things so that there is a single data source with all of the relevant information in a summarized form.
